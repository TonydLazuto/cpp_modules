Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of
seperation to the sunlit path of justice.
Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands
of injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
